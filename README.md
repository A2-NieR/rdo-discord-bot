This specific bot adds the following to the server:
- A message to a specific `#roles` channel to which users can react for server role self assignment via reaction emojis
- Reads the changelog.md of the repository and converts it to a message in a `#bulletin` channel
- Scans the server for a `#pc`, `#ps4` and `#xbox-one` channel, saving the channel ids for further functionality and implements 5 specific slash commands

of which `/setup` is the first command to be used by new users (using other commands without doing the profile setup first will display a message suggesting the user to do the setup first ðŸ¤ ).

After submitting, the info will get saved into your MongoDB Atlas and be updated depending on the commands the users submit:

From then on, players can use the other commands in the channel of their platform either to flag themselves as online/offline or see if anyone else is online. When using `/online` and `/me` the bot also provides buttons for quickly updating the player's info:
